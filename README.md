# Simple Express Application that would allow a user to look up account balance given a card number input

## Installation to run on localhost:3000 ->
`git clone`

`cd *to the cloned directory*`

`npm install`

`node server.js`

### This uses Express for the backend API and server side renders views using an express react render plugin

* Currently a very simple example that could be expanded in features and general improvements to the current UI/screens

* The best next step would be to introduce an underlying database rather than hardcoding the model as is

### Here is the first page where user enters their card details

### Here is the response page that shows the users balance. There is an alternative response if the account cannot be found
